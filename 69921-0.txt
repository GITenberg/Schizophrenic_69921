Tommie Bassford was concerned over the steady frown on his father's
forehead and a little bit hurt because his father hadn't noticed him
for at least an hour. At the age of three, Tommie didn't understand a
lot of things, although sometimes he felt them very keenly. Sometimes
a person's unpleasant mood would be more painful to him than a
spanking--well, that is to say, an ordinary spanking.

He had heard his father say only last night, "It's a chance to make a
million--if I can trust him. And it won't take but a month," he had
said wistfully. "We could move up to the mountains or down to the
seashore. You wouldn't have to worry about Tommie getting picked on by
the big boys next door, and you wouldn't have to quit playing bridge
to come home when you lose your five dollars." His father had looked
at mother fondly. Then he had sobered. "The only thing is--if Pickens
isn't on the level, then we can lose what little business we have, just
as fast."

Tommie thought maybe he could help his father. He gathered up his whole
sun-energy set from the center of the big front window where he liked
best to play. He pulled it across the floor in quantum jerks, moving
backward in a sitting position, pushing himself by digging his heels
into the floor and then straightening his legs. That way he could make
it all in one trip, hugging the sun-energy set to his stomach until he
jammed his back against his father's chair.

He was disappointed that his father did not look down at him and
perhaps pat him on the head. It was most unusual. But Tommie set up his
blocks and then pressed the button and watched the reactions start all
over again. He watched carbon 12 go into nitrogen and then into oxygen
and then into nitrogen 15. Up to that point it went very well, but when
those four hydrogen nuclei, represented by four glowing green balls,
were supposed to combine into one helium nucleus, something went wrong.
They didn't combine right. They smacked into each other with a violent
report and disappeared.

       *       *       *       *       *

At this moment Tommie's father came to life with a startled jump. He
said a word that Tommie, at his age, had never yet dared to say except
to himself, because even though he was a prodigy, his mother didn't
allow him to say da-- he caught it just in time.

Tommie was glad, anyway, that his father had quit staring at the paper.
Tommie stood up to receive the gentle pat on the head that he usually
got from his father's big hand, but as he turned around, astonishingly
enough, his father smacked him on the seat, and, through his red linen
shorts, it stung.

"Will you please take those confounded atom blocks and your one-seventy
I.Q. into the back yard or somewhere, so a man can have some peace?"
His father tried to sound exasperated, but Tommie didn't think he
really meant it.

But Tommie got on his knees and gathered the whole set to his stomach
and hoped there wasn't any dirt on them to get on his white waist. Then
he went out, very disappointed and even a little hurt--in fact, his
eyes felt a little watery--because he thought if dad would tell him
what was the trouble, he could help dad figure out something.

Mother was showing talky Mrs. Jones the new disintichute that disposed
of everything that was waste--soiled clothes, dirty dishes, used
silverware. Tommie wondered why they called it silver. Certainly there
wasn't any silver in it, as everything was plastic now. Everything,
that is, but very special things, like his red linen pants.

Mother smiled at him vaguely, and Mrs. Jones smiled too, but Mrs. Jones
had a sharp, searching look in her eyes that made it seem as if she was
trying to find something wrong so she could punish him. Tommie didn't
care for her. She wouldn't have any right to send him into scrub his
hands again.

"Come here, Tommie," she said in a high cooing voice, and made a move
for him. But Tommie felt a strange, almost violent repugnance toward
her. He backed away and went sideward toward the kitchen door. It
opened, and he lifted his feet high to get over the sill and very
nearly lost his balance doing so.

That annoyed him, too. Being a prodigy was all right if one had a body
to go with it. When a boy had a ten-year-old mind it was irritating to
have a three-year-old body as clumsy as the body of a baby.

He lost an orange-colored electron just outside of the door, but he let
it lie there for a moment. Mrs. Jones was too close to the door. Maybe
Mrs. Jones would go back into the front room where dad was worrying so
much. Secretly Tommie chuckled. Dad didn't like Mrs. Jones any more
than Tommie did. He'd send her home in a hurry.

Tommie set up his blocks and got some spare nuclei out of the box
and started the reaction going again. It puzzled him a lot, why the
hydrogen nuclei didn't combine properly. There must have been some
unusual influence somewhere. In the two days he had had it, he hadn't
been able to complete the carbon cycle once.

Bennie, next door, had a set, and when Bennie tried it, it always
worked fine. Bennie never had lost a nucleus by explosion. Maybe there
was something wrong with Tommie's set. He'd get Bennie to try it--and
maybe Bennie would let Tommie try his set.

Tommie sat there in the white sand, watching the interlaced
orange-glowing orbits of the electrons and the broad green paths of the
hydrogen nuclei. The sun was warm on Tommie's back and the Baltimore
orioles were singing in the elm tree almost over his head. Across the
high electronic fence he could hear the bigger boys playing ball in
Bennie's yard.

       *       *       *       *       *

Suddenly the four hydrogen nuclei, flashing at half light-speed in
their four orbits, went together and disappeared in the usual green
flash and with the customary loud report. Tommie was thankful the
explosion didn't sound as loud out in the yard as it had in the front
room under dad's chair, although secretly Tommie liked it better in the
house because of that very fact.

The only thing was that dad wasn't in a very good mood today.

Tommie watched the orioles sweeping around the tree-top, and the papa
oriole's orange plumage, flashing in the sunlight, reminded him of
the orbit of an electron. Then he remembered that he had dropped an
electron just outside the kitchen door.

He got up laboriously--he was so solid his legs had a hard time holding
him up, sometimes. He went to the door and leaned over to pick up the
electron. He heard the swish of the door as it opened and then the high
cooing of Mrs. Jones' voice as she bore down on him.

"Oh, that dear little boy, I simply must squeeze him."

Tommie stood up suddenly, so suddenly he lost his balance and sat down
on the grass. Mrs. Jones reached for him, and that strange feeling of
repugnance he had for her grew so powerful that it almost smothered
him. He squirmed to get away from her, but he was trapped. She touched
him, and his body quit squirming because mother wouldn't like it, but
in his mind he writhed. It almost seemed that he could tear himself
away from his body.

Then he did! Just how he didn't know, but suddenly he was standing a
couple of feet to one side, watching Mrs. Jones holding the arms of his
first body. He looked down at himself. Yes, he was in a body, too, and
he was wearing red linen pants. This body didn't seem quite as solid as
his first, but solid enough. He looked up at Mrs. Jones triumphantly.

He was surprised to see her drawing back with her mouth open like the
hole in the disintichute. Her eyes were sticking out and her eyebrows
were almost up to her hair.

"Oh! He-he split!" she shrieked. "He-he's got two bodies!"

Tommie was very amused at her antics. He looked over and smiled at his
mother but she too was staring at him with something like horror.

Then Mrs. Jones did something Tommie couldn't understand. She went to
his mother and put her arms around her and cried and said, "Oh, my
dear, I'm so sorry for you. I didn't know you had this burden. All of
us have our crosses to bear--the atomic age has left such dreadful
marks on civilization--but, oh my dear!" She let out a hearty bawl, and
Tommie quit being amused and began to be very disgusted. She looked at
him from under one arm, half afraid, he thought, and then she turned
back to Tommie's mother. "My dear! A schizo--schizo--"

"Schizophrenic," said Tommie Number One helpfully.

"Split personality," Mrs. Jones sputtered. "But physically! Oh, my da--"

Tommie's mother was disengaging herself. "Why don't you go home and
make yourself a nice cup of hot tea, with maybe just a touch of--" She
hesitated.

"Arsenic," Tommie thought promptly. He became one little boy again.

"Ar--" She caught herself and looked at Tommie, horrified. "Just a
touch of brandy," she said.

Mrs. Jones looked bewildered. Oh, this was fun, thought Tommie. He'd
known for some time that he could mentally suggest things for his
parents to say, but he'd never tried it so openly before. He knew one
thing, though. He'd better be plenty careful with this power, or he'd
get walloped. In fact as he thought about it, he didn't feel too sure
about the arsenic deal.

       *       *       *       *       *

Mrs. Jones retired in confusion, and Tommie went back to the sun-energy
set. But when his father and mother were both outside, and mother was
saying as if she were shocked, "Yes, he definitely split in two. I saw
him with my own eyes."

His father looked serious--then he chuckled. "No doubt you would have
done the same thing, if you could have. But I wonder why." He took
Tommie's arm, somewhat gingerly. "Hm." He took the other arm. "He
doesn't do it when we touch him. It must be her repellent personality,
or some phase of it. Insincerity, do you suppose?"

Tommie himself guessed that was it. Mrs. Jones never said what she
meant, and never meant what she said. That was what made Tommie writhe.

His mother and father talked it over, and in the end they didn't seem
too worried about him. "We'll see," said his father, "what develops."
Then his father began to walk around the yard, stretching and sunning
like an orange oriole. He finally sat down in the lawn-chair, and
Tommie's mother sat beside him, and that worried look came back on his
father's face.

"I wish I knew what to say," he murmured absently. "It might be the
chance of a lifetime. The man claims he's got a tube that will make
it possible to send television around the earth. It's worth a lot of
millions if it works."

"Can't you test it?"

Dad shook his head. "It would take twenty-five thousand to test it.
We'd need a lot of equipment. And you can't take it to any of the big
manufacturers, because you'd lose it fast if they discovered it would
work. That's where the gamble comes in. I'd have to back it, sight
unseen."

"There are lots of gyp artists going around," his mother suggested.

"Yes, but darn it, Gwynne, once in a while there's the real thing
drops in your lap, too. Remember Clarence Fisher? He ran into the same
kind of deal--a naive fellow from the country somewhere, had a new
idea for automatic heat control in an electric circuit that did away
with contacts. Something brand new. Clarence took a chance, and look
at him now. Winters in Florida, summers in Acapulco. No worries about
anything. Gosh!"

Tommie thought he'd rather live in the mountains, where he could smell
the pine-trees.

"Can't you check up on Mr. Franklin?"

"I've checked. Not really much background. Claims he's been roaming a
lot. Could be, too. The whole deal is, I guess, we've got a good little
business making ordinary television tubes, and it's a question whether
we want to be sure of a decent living or take a chance on a fortune."

"Maybe it's better to be safe," said Tommie's mother.

"Well--"

Tommie had never seen dad squirm before, but certainly he was squirming
now--mentally, that is. Tommie felt sorry for him, but he went ahead
making a solar system in the sand, because he wanted to hear more. He
felt sure he could help dad if he could find out more about it.

"The worst of it is," his dad went on, "if our competitor should get
hold of a tube like this, it might even put us out of business."

His mother sighed. "It's a problem," she remarked sadly.

"It sure as h--it sure is. It all adds up to this: I have nothing
against him, although he's not very solid from a standpoint of
background. It could be the real thing. Clarence Fisher's was. Maybe
I'm just too conservative--too scared."

"You've checked his blueprints?"

"Yes, and I can't find anything wrong. It looks sound. That's the worst
of it."

"When do you have to let him know?"

"He's coming here at eight o'clock tonight."

Tommie's mother got up from the grass. "Do what you think best,
Howard." She went inside.

       *       *       *       *       *

Little Tommie was glad the man was coming at eight o'clock, so he could
be in on it. He didn't have to go to bed until eight-thirty, and maybe
if they got interested he could get by until nine o'clock, by keeping
quiet.

He got up and went to his dad's chair, but dad didn't notice him.
Dad got up and followed his mother into the house. Tommie went back
to gather up his toys. It would soon be time for the sun to go down,
anyway.

He got the sun-energy set in his arms, and then he had an idea. He went
through the back and over to Bennie's. Bennie was four.

"Will you try my set and let me try yours?" asked Tommie.

Bennie looked down from his half a head of tallness. "I guess so."

They traded. Bennie started up the cycle in Tommie's set. When he was
halfway through, Tommie sat down and started Bennie's set. But he
watched as the four hydrogen nuclei of his own set went together and
formed a glowing blue helium nucleus.

Then he watched Bennie's set between his chubby legs. Presently the
hydrogen nuclei, swirling in their orbits, ran together--and there was
a flash of green light and an explosion. The four nuclei disappeared.

Tommie felt bad. Bennie was indignant. "What's the big idea--making
them explode?" he demanded.

Tommie didn't understand.

"You must have some kind of electricity in you," said Bennie, "that
makes 'em explode."

Tommie thought about that. Yes, there must be something about him.
Maybe the same strange force that enabled him to suggest words to
his mother and that had made it possible this afternoon for him to
split--maybe that did something to the delicately balanced nuclei.

"Look," said Tommie. "I owe you four hydrogens, but I can't pay now,
because then I won't have any left. I'll pay you tomorrow. Is that
okay?"

Bennie was dubious at first, but he thought about it and decided
that would be all right. Tommie went back home with plenty to think
about--so much, in fact, that through dinner he was quite silent as his
father and mother worried about Mr. Franklin and his new television
tube.

Mr. Franklin came promptly at eight, and they all went into the front
room as soon as mother threw the dishes down the chute. Then they had
coffee, and Tommie began to worry. Nobody said anything about business
for a long time.

Tommie went and got his sun-energy set and settled himself under the
arm of his dad's chair. Then he looked up expectantly for a pat on
the head, but instead of that his father was staring at him. Tommie
remembered how the hydrogen nuclei had misbehaved, so he got to his
feet again and went for his chlorophyl kit. He set that up and turned
on the little artificial sun and then just watched. It was fun to see
the sunlight soak into the green liquid in the test tubes, and come out
at the bottom as bubbles of carbon dioxide. It was quiet, too.

"So you think," his father was saying, "that we should have fifty
thousand to start with."

"We should have about twenty-five cash, and twenty-five in reserve,"
Mr. Franklin said. He was a very handsome man.

"How long will it take us to get into production?"

"That all depends on you," said Mr. Franklin. "The only thing we have
to worry about is getting the germanium. That stuff is scarce, but I
think if we take the cash, I know where we can lay hands on a couple of
hundred pounds. It will take about ten thousand to swing that end of
the deal."

       *       *       *       *       *

Just about then Tommie felt his father was beginning to squirm. "What
do you think?" he asked Tommie's mother.

She shook her head. "You're the business man, Howard. That is for you
to decide."

Mr. Franklin laughed pleasantly, "That is a very wise observation,
madam. Too many women try to run their husbands' affairs. I say you are
very wise."

But Tommie felt something else. His mother was troubled, too. Tommie
slowed the chlorophyl cycle so he could watch the light reflect from
the nitrogen molecules at the bottom. He wondered why his mother was
troubled. Tommie frowned.

Then Mr. Franklin took some papers from his inside coat pocket. "I have
the contract, the way your attorney approved it," he said casually. "We
might as well get that part of it settled. You don't need to put up any
money till tomorrow." He laughed, and Tommie's ears pricked up. That
laugh sounded strange. "I'll take you on faith," Mr. Franklin said, and
handed the papers to his father.

Mr. Bassford frowned and began to read. Tommie got up and stood
against one knee. There were a lot of typewritten pages, mostly with
'whereases' and 'parties of the second part.' Tommie squeezed close,
looking at Mr. Franklin, but his father didn't put his arms around him.
"Go away, Tommie. Go play," he said.

Tommie was hurt. He stared at Mr. Franklin and he was puzzled at the
strange look in Mr. Franklin's eyes as Mr. Franklin stared at him.

Presently Tommie's father looked up. "I guess that's it," he said.

Mr. Franklin was already handing him a pen. It was one of those new
eternity pens with a built-in radiant light. Tommie edged closer. His
father took it. He laid the papers on the writing-arm of the chair and
poised the pen for an instant, made a flourish in the air, and started
to write.

Tommie was bending over to watch the little light. His dad stared at
him in that contemplative way and said, "You're jiggling me, Tommie.
Why don't you go over and sit on Mr. Franklin's lap while I sign the
papers?" Tommie didn't want to sit on Mr. Franklin's lap, but from the
look in his dad's eyes he knew it was a command. He turned around.

Mr. Franklin was reaching for him. "Here, little man, come here to me,"
he said. "I'll hold you while your father signs the paper that will
make us all millionaires." He reached out to pat Tommie on the head.

Tommie wasn't very clear as to what a millionaire was, but he knew
one thing--he didn't want Mr. Franklin patting him on the head.
He squirmed away, toward his dad. Mr. Franklin reached for him
surprisingly fast. In fact, his movement was so quick you could hardly
see it. Tommie dodged again, and this time he was in a little panic. He
felt that same repugnance he had felt for Mrs. Jones. He didn't want
Mr. Franklin to touch him.

But Mr. Franklin got him by the arm. He held hard, and it hurt, while
Mr. Franklin was smiling with a sort of stiff mouth. "Now, now, come
and sit on my lap, little man."

       *       *       *       *       *

Tommie tried to twist away. Mr. Franklin held hard. Tommie squirmed.
He couldn't get loose from Mr. Franklin's grip. He squirmed harder. He
broke free. That is, he projected himself to one side and looked at Mr.
Franklin holding what was really his shell.

[Illustration: The boy looked at Mr. Franklin, who was holding what was
really his shell.]

Mr. Franklin was startled, but he didn't hesitate. "Oh, a schizo,"
he said, and something came into his face that was frightening. He
snatched at Tommie's second self with one arm. He caught Tommie by the
belt on his red linen pants and pulled the second one toward him.

Tommie split again. Now he stood off to one side and watched, a little
fearfully. Mr. Franklin was getting pretty angry. But Tommie's father
spoke up. "Why not just let him go?" he said, and the way he said it,
it was a command that he expected to be obeyed. Mr. Franklin looked up
and slowly turned Tommie loose. Tommie straightened his belt and his
three selves went back together.

His father was handing the papers back to Mr. Franklin. "I've changed
my mind," he said. "I'll take a chance on being a small business man."

It was rather unpleasant for a few minutes, but Mr. Franklin left, with
his papers in his pocket.

Tommie's father was sitting back in the big chair with a half smile on
his face. "So a phony makes Tommie split, eh." He chuckled. "Tommie's
right. Not that I would blame any man for not particularly caring for
children. That's a man's privilege. But I didn't like that ugly gleam
in Franklin's eyes when he thought Tommie was going to interfere."

Tommie was pretty much unstrung. He sat down under the arm of his
father's chair and pressed the button that started the carbon cycle.

"I'm glad we found out in time, Howard," said his mother. "But what
about Tommie?" She sounded worried. "Do you think--"

"It's probably nothing serious, and probably nothing that we can do
anything about. If he wants to split when un-nice people come around,
that's his business. Anyway, he'll probably outgrow it in a few years.
Most of them do."

Tommie watched the four hydrogen nuclei go together, and instinctively
he drew back for the explosion. But there wasn't any. The four went
together into the blue ball that meant a helium nucleus. Tommie clapped
his hands. They had worked right this time. Maybe his body energy had
been drained by the double split until it didn't affect them any more.

Tommie's mother looked at him softly. Tommie looked back softly. Then
he sidled up against his father's leg. His father reached down and
caught him around the chest and squeezed him hard.

It made Tommie very happy. "Dad," he said, "what's a phony?"

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
